Programs for processing the Master Freight Network (MFN), Master Highway Network (MHN), and Master Rail Network (MRN) for freight/travel modeling. 

At a conceptual level, the way MFN/MHN/MRN fit together for processing is described by the (greatly simplified) diagram:

To get started with this repository, check out the wiki. 

## Objectives 
This repository holds scripts and tools where the MFN, MHN, and MRN (and any other necessary files) can be processed together for input into either the freight model or travel model for analysis. 

There are four main objectives:
1. Currently there are three separate repositories for the MFN, MHN, and MRN. The freight model requires input from both the MFN and the MHN, while the travel model requires input from both the MHN and the MRN. This repository aims to resolve inconsistencies between the three original repositories.
2. All three of the original repositories have code written in multiple languages, including SAS. Sometimes a Python script will call a SAS script or an R script will call a SAS script. This repository aims to have its code written in Python and R and to completely eliminate reliance on SAS.
3. This repository also aims to simplify the three processes. Input/output should be made clear, as well as script dependencies. It aims to avoid nested scripts and chicken/egg situations (where running script A depends on the output of script B while running script B depends on the output of script A). 
4. Everything should be well documented.

By the end of my internship (9/4/2025) I hope to have the parts which process the MHN finished (essentially, complete the task that I was given by Tim). The orange in the diagram represents that goal.
